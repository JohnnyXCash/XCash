Development process
===========================

The master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed
to be completely stable. Tags are regularly created to indicate new
stable release versions of XCash.

The master branch is likely to be unstable or contain work-in-progress
as new features are built and readied for the next release.

XCash aims for a regular release cycle of features following a bi-weekly
pace, although the timeframe may vary depending on the complexity of
the backlog.  XCash is building a large array of wallet features and 
network/daemon infrastructure to support a large and dynamic ecosystem.

Service providers and users should always use the latest tagged release
version.
